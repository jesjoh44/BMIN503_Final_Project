FINAL PROJECT

Infection is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation. Contemporary studies on the epidemiology of infections after lung transplantation could inform research on prevention. We retrospectively obtained all microbiology data collected post-transplant from subjects in the Lung Transplant Outcomes Group multi-center cohort at 3 sites. Data were obtained via bulk electronic health record downloads and processed either on-site or centrally using similar methods.
